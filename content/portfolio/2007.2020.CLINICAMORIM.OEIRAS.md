MEDICAL AND DENTAL CLINIC. 2 FLOORS 85 M2. LICENSING PROJECT

<!--more-->

## BRIEFING
Family run dental practice, in Oeiras. The clinic moved into a small retail space in 2005.
The project was licensing plan with healthcare specifications alongside the general building legislation. 
In 2020 there was a need from an update. New reception and waiting areas, an X-Ray office, new rooms were incorporated.

## PROJECT
The concept was based on the context: The proximity of local clients and personalized treatment in a practice with 30 yearsâ€™ experience. The wish was to avoid white and cold interiors, similar to franchised clinics. 
Designing a small area with 3 offices, public and private zones, was key to the concept: Geometry, precision, minimal decoration, abundant use of mirrors and glass. 
One of the most important considerations was color. Various shades of ivory were used. Honesty dictated the choice since all smiles are unique and white similes tend to be Photoshop.
